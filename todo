mongo- we need to be able to add more users to the existing database without removing existing users. an add_users.js

could also create another script to add to pick a random user, check if they have no users, then add a random number of users.
If they have users, reciprocate some of those users
Then out of reciprocated users, create a random number of lorem ipsum messages between them

then functionality. we want to be able to add one or many users. perhaps and  arraylist of arrays, each array adds a user with the arbitrary datails passed into the array as arguments.
then a add_friend.js, takes in two users, first one is the requester the other is the recipient
then send_message.js, this script takes two users plus the message to be sent.

Some notes in local assignment folder for the readme on how to user the scripts properly

There hasnet been any indexes set on the documents except for the members document

Replication and sharding to be done
